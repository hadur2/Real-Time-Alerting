# Real-Time-Alerting

Used Scanner which will allow user to put in there input.

Then it will print the prompts for the user

After, I used sc.nextLine witch assigns the variable input string for the user.

Next, Strings will be spplit with commas.

Then, I used an a arraylist to hold the inputs.

Next, I used a for loop to iterate through the string arry

After, the string will be change into an interger, string array and a list.

Then, If conditions are met will return no alert.

If conditions are not met will return violated.
